## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.0 or higher recommended.
- MySQL 5.7 or higher.
- Node.js and npm for Tailwind builds.
- Apache/XAMPP/WAMP or the PHP built-in development server.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aungkyawthetx/tracex.git
cd tracex
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create the database

Create a MySQL database before running the setup script:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tracex CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### 4. Configure database connection

Open `config/db.php` and update the values for your local environment:

```php
$DB_HOST = "localhost";
$DB_NAME = "tracex";
$DB_USER = "root";
$DB_PASS = "";
```

### 5. Create tables and seed defaults

```bash
php database/setup.php
```

Useful setup options:

```bash
php database/setup.php --fresh
php database/setup.php --fresh --kill-connections
php database/setup.php --no-seed
php database/setup.php --fresh --no-seed
```

### 6. Build Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm run build
```

For active UI development, run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### 7. Run the application

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

The landing page is available at `/`. After signing in, the app redirects to:

```text
http://localhost:8000/public/index.php
```

## Database Tables

The setup script manages these tables:

- `users`
- `categories`
- `payment_methods`
- `expenses`
- `budgets`
- `savings`
- `saving_transactions`

## npm Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run serve` | Start PHP dev server at `localhost:8000`. |
| `npm run build` | Build minified Tailwind CSS. |
| `npm run watch` | Watch Tailwind input and rebuild on changes. |
| `npm test` | Placeholder test script. |

## Troubleshooting

- If the database connection fails, confirm `config/db.php` and make sure the database exists.
- If tables are missing or outdated, run `php database/setup.php --fresh`.
- If fresh setup hangs because of local MySQL locks, run `php database/setup.php --fresh --kill-connections`.
- If styles are missing or stale, run `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.
- If `npm run serve` is already using port `8000`, stop the existing server or run PHP manually on another port.
